I often need to 2 factor authenticate applications for work
which typically involves unlocking and engaging with my phone
for a brief moment. Once eyes are trained on the screen,
all bets are off. What starts as a simple login ends halfway
down a NY Times article, A smartwatch gives you freedom from
the smartphone rabbit hole by letting you engage with notificat-
ions without access to the whole suite of attention stealing apps.
The key to making this work is to be ruthless about which notif-
ications you allow through. Uninstall anything that you do not
regularly use. Mute notifications on the apps you want to keep
but don&#x27;t want to hear from. If you aren&#x27;t ready to kill your
social media accounts, at least mute them. I&#x27;ve even gone as far
as creating a new phone number and email address that is only
ever shared with REAL people that I care about and would want to
respond to immediately. This: way I can turn off notifications fom
the junk and let bots quietly churn in silence, If you&#x27;ve already
burned your current number by sticking it in one too many sketchy
web forms, just port it over to google voice and start fresh</p><p class="text_text__njvmA" style="--size:var(--size-font-xl)">with your carrier.
Ideally your watch should only notify you about things you
really care about. No time wasters allowed! Once you have
achieved notification bliss, I urge you to experiment with
leaving your phone on your nightstand (or wherever it rests)
any time you are home. If my own experience is any indication,
you won&#x27;t always succeed in this experiment. So ask yourself...
What is it you regularly need your phone for? Can you get this
some other way? For me it was music, so I bought myself a
walkman, Yes they still exist, Do you play games on your phone?
Try a dedicated gaming handheld. Read the news? Get a
magazine subscription...
