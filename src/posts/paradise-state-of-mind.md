Foster the People took the world by storm with the release of Torches in 2011. It was the sound of the time and may as well have been the Millennial generation's anthem. It was an age of potential. We were young, Obama was president and it truly felt like the world were going to tackle serious issues like climate change and inequality. Torches reflected that with its joyful optimism and loud, pop antics.

But... Something went wrong.

Paradise State of Mind feels like a direct response to Torches.
