As a rescue that had been in the system for the first six years of
her life, Bree took some time to open up. She was notoriously
bad at playing with other dogs; usually barking loudly in their
faces or hoarding the toy that every other dog wanted to play
with. Her favorite game to play was &quot;this is mine now and I&#x27;m
taking it to my bed&quot; By the end of her life, Bree had completely
transformed. I&#x27;ve never felt more proud than the moment my

We obvicusly got on quite well\non account of us being married now, but the dogs took longer\n\nto warm up to each other. Bugsy was a simple boy that wanted\n\nto be friends with everyone. He adored Bree and followed her\nevery lead. Even when that lead was misdirection to distract\n\nhim from the more desireable bed. Bree was much smarter than\nBugsy and mostly saw him as competition for soft sleeping surfaces.\nAs a rescue that had been in the system for the first six years of\nher life, Bree took some time to open up. She was notoriously\nbad at playing with other dogs; usually barking loudly in their\nfaces or hoarding the toy that every other dog wanted to play\nwith. Her favorite game to play was \"this is mine now and I'm\ntaking it to my bed\" By the end of her life, Bree had completely\ntransformed. I've never felt more proud than the moment my\nsenior lady instigated play time with my in-law's bichon.\n\nBree wasn't the only one changed by the relationship. I came out\nthe other side a much more patient and understanding caretaker.\n\nI regret the moments I was upset with her and tried to make her\nwhat IT wanted rather than understand who she was. She taught me\nwhat an integral part of the family a petcan and should be.\nOutside of my wife, Bree was my best friend. Not my accessory.\nThat does make me retroactively guilty for my childhood pets\n\nbut also sheds a joyful light on the animal relationships to\ncome.\n"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[slug]","query":{"slug":"pets"},"buildId":"QyRH3ZkAc-HsnbENDAToW","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
